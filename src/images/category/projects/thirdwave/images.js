  projectDescr: [
    'Third Wave is a famous coffee brand located in Koramangala. We needed to alter the logo while keeping the changes to a bare minimum. The challenge was that the previous logo and packaging was not looking good on the shelves. It felt dull and lacklustre. We needed to redesign the logo while taking care not to replace it in entirety ‚Äì as Third Wave was an established brand with a strong presence. We had to make the packaging more desirable.',
    'Riding on the latest trend, we have not only redesigned the logo but also spread the goodness to encompass the packaging, which was previously dull. We drew inspiration from the coffee plantations. We used doodle art to add a wow factor to our packaging design. We felt that a lot of the packaging in the independent market is similar, with predominantly brown craft bags. We wanted to celebrate the visual richness and flavour of the coffee, with doodle art emulating the affinity towards nature.',
    'The three waves show that it is a third generation coffee. The artistic strokes inside those waves show the evolution, clarity and richness of taste.'
