    'When you type a lengthy email or prepare a presentation before dashing off to the airport ‚Äì does your back hurt, and eyes turn watery? What about a professional content writer who needs to do it all day?',
    'This desk was designed for a content writer who was very particular about what he wanted and could not settle for anything less than perfect. The end product needed to bear a close semblance to nature. The client told us very clearly that it should be simple, basic, natural and transportable. He did not want any drawers. All he needed to do was to place a laptop above it and design content for clients.',
    'We created a desk, which was durable as well as portable. The natural wooden texture with matte finish is there for a purpose ‚Äì to honour the client‚Äôs request to feel very close to nature. We have not  compromised on the sturdiness; we have made this table unshakable by using metal fixtures. We named the project after our client.'
