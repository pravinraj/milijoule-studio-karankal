    'When it comes to getting the best of a cold night nothing beats a hot cup of chocolate. It is undoubtedly one of the all-time winter favourites. We are all aware of the many forms of chocolate we have devoured. But have you ever heard of ‚Äúcacao nibs‚Äô?',
    'Cacao nibs are just pure unadulterated chocolate with zero additives. These are dried and fermented bits of cacao beans. The texture of our raw organic cacao nibs is similar to that of roasted coffee beans. They have a deep chocolate flavour which is slightly bitter and nutty.',
    'Why is the brand named as cacao? Cacao‚Äù and ‚Äúcocoa‚Äù were just two ways of saying the same thing; as far as I am concerned, chocolate is chocolate. But, here is where things get complicated. While cacao and cocoa start their journey from the same place, they end up in different places because of separate processes they undergo along the way. Let me explain.',
    'The story of ‚Äòchocolate‚Äô as we universally know starts from the Theobroma cacao tree. Its fruits are cracked open by harvesters to reveal cacao beans; they are subsequently roasted. The taste depends on various factors like upbringing, soil, and sunlight. These beans are fermented and dried before further processing. What happens next determines whether the seeds become cacao or cocoa. They start from the same place, but the types of processing make all the difference.',
    'The illustration, as usual, follows bold doodles, without much detail. I love creating a fun, fresh, teeny-weeny bit classy cocoa nibble packaging. The concept revolves around cacao fruit surrounded by nibs. The doodling features cacao nibbles surrounding a cross-section drawing of cacao. The Theobroma cacao fruit mostly inspires the elements used in the design.'
