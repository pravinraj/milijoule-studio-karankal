    'This is the concept we used for one of our clients, a footwear store. Initially, we researched to understand the area, Indiranagar ‚Äì specifically the shops lining the 100 feet road. There are malls, restaurants, and stores on both sides. The typical customers you find here are house owners and IT employees i.e., a mixed crowd.',
    "For indoor space planning, we took into consideration malls and individual stores. We checked out competitors. We noticed that the reputed multi-brand stores in the vicinity arrange footwear according to brands. However, smaller showrooms arrange them according to the type, i.e., casual, formal and sport. These are further classified into mens, womens and kids' footwear sections.",
    'This particular store theme was inspired by the; Mumbai Subway & When you take a walk on the subway, you will find that it is a subset of cultures, with historic old buildings, artifacts, and trendy shops lining both sides. This is the picture we have tried to paint inside this store. Each element shows the blend of old and new.',
    'For instance, the street lights structure is old; it is hence coated in white to add a touch of modernity - hence a mix of old and new. The bicycle is part of our heritage; it is again painted white to add a generous dose of modernity. The wall texture shows the traditional red bricks. However, you will notice that the window paneling follows modern trends.',
    "Now, what's the idea behind the walkway?",
    "We all wear shoes outside right? Our time is spent commuting to work, or interacting with others, on the walkway. Many use this route, whether it is for boarding the metro train or dashing off to the office or tech park. Simply put, the walkway is a place where your & shoes feel at home & That's how the concept came about. Attachments area. "
