  projectDescr: [
    'The word “Asana” is meant to describe yogic postures or movements. But more traditionally, it translates to ‘a seat’. It can either be a stool or chair. Upon research, we found that 60% of Indian households have a stool rather than a chair at home.',
    'Therefore, we cherry-picked ‘A’, from Asana, and redesigned it look like a stool. You will notice that the letter has smooth edges. These soft contours signify customisation, elegance and smoothness.',
    'The line on top of the letter ‘A’ takes its inspiration from the Sanskrit writing style and thus adds an element of culture and tradition. The purpose of this logo is to become an easily recognisable urniture brand. The modern and elegant look is self-explanatory and makes people recognise our brand!'
