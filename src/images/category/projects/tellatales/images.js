  projectDescr: [
    'Tella Tales is a smooth and silky journey into the confectionery world, with obsessive taste wrapped in ribbons of chocolate. It is a brand for the fun-loving college students with a spirit of adventure oozing through their veins. It embraces the young working-class endowed with a sweet tooth, and love gobbling up jars of Nutella.',
    'After extensive research, we considered a broader approach to Tella Tales. When we started this brand, we set out on a mission ‚Äì ‚ÄúUnderstanding the youth and young working class‚Äù. Given the fact that most people on planet Earth love Nutella, we interviewed people to try and understand what kind of environs are most conducive to enjoy Nutella. Is it the seaside, city, desert or perhaps mountains?',
    'After analysing the answers given by our customers, it became apparent that most of them prefer either mountains or forests; this gave us the adrenaline to research further. We found that extrusion mountain was a perfect match, the kind of setting which gave Nutella fans a new high. Now, of course, we didn‚Äôt want to show the hill as the theme for Nutella, so it was added in abstract form, as a befitting and abstract backdrop - so that the product got exclusive attention.'
