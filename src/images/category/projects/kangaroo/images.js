  projectDescr: [
    'Animal characters inspired this bar stool design. We collaborated with local artisans for design authenticity. They usually use MS rod when they need strength and flexibility. We took inspiration from the kangaroo. The stool was made simple; a single MS rod was used from the beginning, right up to the end.',
    'Our craftsman was a traditional metal worker whose ancestors in charge of manufacture and supply of swords to the king Tipu Sultan. Fashioning the piece of art from a single rod was indeed a complex task. It is pure handcrafted natural wood PLUS metal and matt finish. What‚Äôs more, you also have a footrest ‚Äì adding to the form and functionality. The aesthetically curved wooden seat acts as the icing on top of this masterpiece. This multifunctional stool looks stunning in cafes as well as living rooms.'
