    'When an object is dropped in water, there is a transfer of energy from the object to the water. this energy travels in all the directions, creating ripples and waves in the still water. The design is inspired by the phenomenon of propagation of waves in water. Our aim was to balance the abstraction and give it a proper form.  The final product is created with high gloss stainless steel. When the product is placed outdoor, the colour of sky is reflected in the product, hence increasing the aesthetics and user experience simultaneously Dimensions are area 2x11, seating height 18".'
