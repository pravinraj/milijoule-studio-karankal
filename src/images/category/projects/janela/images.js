    'The tiny state of Goa is a very popular tourist destination, thanks to its pristine beaches. The city also has Indo-Portuguese architectural marvels in the form of residences and churches, dating back to the 1700s.',
    'Janela in Portuguese means ‘Window’. The essence of these magnificent buildings lies in their signature windows. The packaging of Janela chocolate thus reflects Goa’s rich heritage. These windows come in a myriad of colours; as also reflected through our package design. This is a chocolate brand exclusively belonging to Goa, and we were tasked with creating the package design which spoke about its rich heritage. Through these chocolate branding, we endeavour to reflect Goa’s charm and ambience in our own humble way. These chocolates come in various flavours and proportions of cacao and are sweetened with honey.'
