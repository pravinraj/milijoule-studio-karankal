  projectDescr: [
    'This kitchen was designed for an apartment in a prestigious gated community (‚ÄòPrestige Shantiniketan‚Äô) in Bengaluru. We visited the client to analyse their existing space, personal profile & requirements, functionality, and aesthetics.',
    'We had to tread our path carefully; if we chose a vibrant colour scheme, the limited space & light, would not do justice to the interior. Thus, we came up a white and grey kitchen theme. We also kept everything symmetrical and in a straight line.',
    'As always, we manufactured everything in our factory and visited the flat only during installation. Most of our clients prefer it that way, thus avoiding the dust, noise and other inconveniences ‚Äì that accompany a typical on-site work.',
    'While designing, we give special attention to : Convenient storage of utensils, Storage of raw materials, Placement of kitchen appliances',
    'The kitchen was built in L-shape, to give easy access to the sink from the stove, and vice-versa, thus reducing the cooking time. You will notice a partition in the above pictures. That separates the washing area from the cooking area, thus avoiding the clutter.',
    'The above case study serves to enlighten prospective clients about our user-centric approach to each project.'
