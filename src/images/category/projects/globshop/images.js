    'This project was meant for Gensler. We coordinated with the San Francisco and Shanghai teams from our Bengaluru office. The purpose was to get a broader perspective into the retail spaces of these great cities. Our task was the qualitative and quantitative research of the market in Bengaluru. A few surveys, later ‚Äì we could narrow down to the main influencing factors of our Indian retail market. Our team got to know about the strategies used for selling on streets, brand outlets and malls. Our research was exclusively focused on apparel.',
    'E.g., Commercial street in Bengaluru has small retail spaces. The mannequins are just outside the shop, and the merchandise is cluttered. The same retail brands have large and spacious showrooms in Koramangala ‚Äì with a different arrangement for clothes and mannequins. The mall arrangement is different; here things are more spacious, and the interiors entirely different. We prepared the above blueprint to help international brands create a sensational entry into the Indian market.'
