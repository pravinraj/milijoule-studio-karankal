    'Outside of family and friends, I am sure your laptop, gets a share of your companionship during free time. Whether you choose to watch Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones ‚Äì it is entirely up to you. However, you will need a stand, or a centre table to keep it at viewing height. Why not keep place it on your lap? I am sure most of you know that putting a laptop on your lap exposes vital organs to electromagnetic radiation (EMR) and affects their reproductive capabilities. The only solution seems to be a centre table. I have observed people trying to adjust their gaze to the laptop placed on this centre table by arching their back ‚Äì trying to find their right level.',
    'What is the solution?',
    'This twist laptop table was conceptualised keeping in mind all the above points. We constructed it using a single plank. It can be given different forms limited only by the user‚Äôs imagination. It can be made into a 30-inch high table ideal for your laptop. It can also transform into an 18-inch centre table. We have also used solid rubberwood with teak wood finish polish; the table can be customised to any position you choose.'
