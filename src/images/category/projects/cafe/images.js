  projectDescr: [
    'The concept revolves around Chikmagalur which is one of the best coffee growing areas in India. They are nurtured by farmers in coffee plantations that cover the slopes of Coorg and Chikmagalur like a vast green blanket. We wanted to incorporate the natural surroundings and the feel of nature with gentle strokes a.k.a. Doodling. In western countries, the crop is harvested by people wearing gloves. But, in India, it involves a personal touch, which inspires exceptional taste. The coffee bean‚Äôs vibrant colour shows through the doodling incorporating cherries to drive home the point.'
