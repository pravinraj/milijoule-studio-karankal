  projectDescr: [
    'The client wanted us to design a work desk this home-office when he started as an entrepreneur. We observed his space and came up with the grasshopper table that features an expandable and collapsible design (by 4 - 6 inches) for space modulation. While designing this work desk, we considered wire management and a cup holder.',
    'What on earth is wire management?',
    'Well, we make sure that all the wires and cables of your laptop or desktop are hidden, thus keeping everything neat, apart from revealing your aesthetic taste buds. After all, who loves to work in an office with cables and wires for uncluttered and professional looks. The table is also transportable and easy to dismantle. It is rectangular, has a radius finish at the corner edges giving it a touch of elegance.',
    'We used 100% rubberwood with a perfect treatment to give it - a polished semi-gloss teak wood finish.'
